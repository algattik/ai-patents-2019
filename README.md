# AI Patents Data 2019

## About

In April 2019, IPlytics released a report analyzing 448,684 patents filed over the last 10 years in the field of AI [1]. I have adapted a chart published by Statista [2] to include additional data from the IPlytics report, including metrics for technical relevance and filings by country.

I have [posted the following chart on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6551404459820359680):
